# Provenance register

This is the clean-room evidence ledger for `jet3-rs`. It records the origin of
every technical format claim, observed behavior, experiment, and fixture used
by production code or validation. A claim is not implementation evidence until
its stable ID is cited by the relevant format note, test, or source-code
constant.

This initial register contains no Jet format claims, observations, experiments,
or fixtures.

## Rules

- Use public documentation, independently observed files, project-generated
  fixtures, and behavior measured through Microsoft DAO.
- Do not inspect, copy, translate, adapt, or derive implementation knowledge
  from MDB Tools, mdbtools-pure-rs, Jackcess, UCanAccess, or other MDB
  implementations.
- A third-party implementation may be invoked only as a licensed black-box
  oracle. Record the command, version, license basis, inputs, and outputs, but
  do not inspect or describe its implementation.
- Record raw observations separately from interpretations. Contradictory
  evidence remains in the ledger and is resolved by a new entry rather than
  rewriting history.
- Hash referenced files with SHA-256. Do not commit fixtures whose origin or
  redistribution rights are unknown.
- Changes to a cited source, protocol, fixture, or scenario create a new entry
  or revision; they do not silently replace prior evidence.

## Entry fields

Every entry contains:

- **ID:** `SRC-nnnn`, `OBS-nnnn`, `EXP-nnnn`, or `FIX-nnnn`.
- **Recorded:** ISO 8601 date and author.
- **Kind:** public source, observation, experiment, generated fixture, donated
  fixture, or black-box result.
- **Question:** the narrowly stated fact being investigated.
- **Origin:** citation or exact generation source; include access date for web
  sources.
- **Environment:** relevant OS, architecture, tool/provider versions, locale,
  code pages, and time zone.
- **Protocol:** exact reproducible steps or a repository path to the versioned
  protocol/scenario.
- **Artifacts:** repository paths and SHA-256 hashes of inputs and outputs.
- **Observation:** factual result, separated from inference.
- **Interpretation:** the limited conclusion used by the project.
- **Usage:** source constants, tests, and documents that cite this ID.
- **Rights:** license, redistribution status, and any restrictions.
- **Review:** reviewer and review date.

Use `not applicable` explicitly rather than omitting a field.
