# Provenance register

This is the clean-room evidence ledger for `jet3-rs`. It records the origin of
every technical format claim, observed behavior, experiment, and fixture used
by production code or validation. A claim is not implementation evidence until
its stable ID is cited by the relevant format note, test, or source-code
constant.

This register begins with public Microsoft documentation, independently
observed donated files, and bounded page-stride experiments. Donor descriptions
are metadata, not proof of format or DAO compatibility.

## Rules

- Use public documentation, independently observed files, project-generated
  fixtures, and behavior measured through Microsoft DAO.
- Do not inspect, copy, translate, adapt, or derive implementation knowledge
  from MDB Tools, mdbtools-pure-rs, Jackcess, UCanAccess, or other MDB
  implementations.
- A third-party implementation may be invoked only as a licensed black-box
  oracle. Record the command, version, license basis, inputs, and outputs, but
  do not inspect or describe its implementation.
- Record raw observations separately from interpretations. Contradictory
  evidence remains in the ledger and is resolved by a new entry rather than
  rewriting history.
- Hash referenced files with SHA-256. Do not commit fixtures whose origin or
  redistribution rights are unknown.
- Changes to a cited source, protocol, fixture, or scenario create a new entry
  or revision; they do not silently replace prior evidence.

## Entry fields

Every entry contains:

- **ID:** `SRC-nnnn`, `OBS-nnnn`, `EXP-nnnn`, or `FIX-nnnn`.
- **Recorded:** ISO 8601 date and author.
- **Kind:** public source, observation, experiment, generated fixture, donated
  fixture, or black-box result.
- **Question:** the narrowly stated fact being investigated.
- **Origin:** citation or exact generation source; include access date for web
  sources.
- **Environment:** relevant OS, architecture, tool/provider versions, locale,
  code pages, and time zone.
- **Protocol:** exact reproducible steps or a repository path to the versioned
  protocol/scenario.
- **Artifacts:** repository paths and SHA-256 hashes of inputs and outputs.
- **Observation:** factual result, separated from inference.
- **Interpretation:** the limited conclusion used by the project.
- **Usage:** source constants, tests, and documents that cite this ID.
- **Rights:** license, redistribution status, and any restrictions.
- **Review:** reviewer and review date.

Use `not applicable` explicitly rather than omitting a field.

## Public sources

### SRC-0001 — DAO Jet 3 database creation option

- Recorded: 2026-07-23, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: Which DAO option requests a Jet 3 database, and how is encryption
  avoided?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “DBEngine.CreateDatabase method (DAO),” accessed
  2026-07-23,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/dbengine-createdatabase-method-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited page from Microsoft Learn and inspect the
  `Option` parameter table and the remarks immediately following it
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores a citation, not a redistributed
  copy
- Observation: Microsoft documents `dbVersion30` as creating the Microsoft Jet
  3.0 file format, compatible with version 3.5. It also documents that omitting
  the encryption constant creates an unencrypted database.
- Interpretation: authoritative empty and generated oracle fixtures must call
  DAO `CreateDatabase` with `dbVersion30` and without `dbEncrypt`. This source
  does not establish any physical file-layout fact or prove that a generated
  file is accepted by Rust.
- Usage: `docs/validation/ACCEPTANCE.md` G3;
  `oracle/windows-dao/README.md`
- Rights: citation to public Microsoft documentation; no documentation content
  is redistributed
- Review: pending independent review

### SRC-0002 — DAO `dbVersion30` numeric value

- Recorded: 2026-07-23, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: What numeric value must a late-bound COM caller pass for the DAO
  `dbVersion30` enumeration member?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “DatabaseTypeEnum enumeration (DAO),” accessed
  2026-07-23,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/databasetypeenum-enumeration-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited page from Microsoft Learn and inspect the
  enumeration table row named `dbVersion30`
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores a citation, not a redistributed
  copy
- Observation: Microsoft documents the numeric value of `dbVersion30` as 32 and
  describes it as Microsoft Jet database engine version 3.0.
- Interpretation: a PowerShell oracle using late-bound DAO COM may pass integer
  32 when the named enumeration constant is unavailable. This establishes only
  the oracle API argument, not a byte value or offset in an MDB file.
- Usage: `oracle/windows-dao/scripts/probe-provider.ps1`
- Rights: citation to public Microsoft documentation; no documentation content
  is redistributed
- Review: pending independent review

### SRC-0003 — DAO system-table attribute

- Recorded: 2026-07-23, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: Which DAO `TableDef.Attributes` flag identifies a system table,
  and what value must a late-bound COM caller use?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “TableDefAttributeEnum enumeration (DAO),” accessed
  2026-07-23,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/tabledefattributeenum-enumeration-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited page from Microsoft Learn and inspect the
  enumeration table row named `dbSystemObject`
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores a citation, not a redistributed
  copy
- Observation: Microsoft documents `dbSystemObject` as the flag for a system
  table and gives its numeric value as -2147483646.
- Interpretation: the DAO oracle may apply this flag to `TableDef.Attributes`
  when excluding system tables from an empty user-schema snapshot. This does
  not establish how a system-table attribute is encoded in an MDB file.
- Usage: `oracle/windows-dao/scripts/run-dao-gen-probe.ps1`
- Rights: citation to public Microsoft documentation; no documentation content
  is redistributed
- Review: pending independent review

### SRC-0004 — Microsoft Jet file signatures

- Recorded: 2026-07-23, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: Which byte sequences does Microsoft publish for detecting a Jet
  database file independently of its filename extension?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-028 - Critical,”
  accessed 2026-07-23,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-028
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited page and inspect the “Block MDB files from being
  processed through your mail infrastructure” workaround
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores a citation, not a redistributed
  copy
- Observation: Microsoft calls all three listed values “15-byte signatures” at
  offset `0x4` and renders them as `Jet System DB `, `Standard Jet DB`, and
  `Temp Jet DB `. The rendered Standard literal is exactly 15 bytes, while the
  rendered System and Temp literals are shorter than 15 bytes.
- Interpretation: an exact 15-byte `Standard Jet DB` match is evidence that a
  file has a Microsoft-published Jet marker. The source does not expose the
  remaining bytes of the 15-byte window after the rendered System and Temp
  literals, so no padding bytes are inferred for them. A signature match does
  not identify a Jet generation, prove that the rest of the file is well
  formed, or establish DAO compatibility.
- Usage: `crates/jet3/src/header.rs`; `crates/jet3/src/database_header.rs`;
  `crates/jet3/src/candidate.rs`;
  `crates/jet3-cli/src/main.rs`; `OBS-0001`;
  `docs/validation/EXTERNAL_CORPUS.md`

  is redistributed
- Review: pending independent review

### SRC-0005 — Jet database page size

- Recorded: 2026-07-23, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: What page-size change distinguishes the Jet 4.0 MDB format from
  the preceding Jet format generation?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “Database Size/Page Size,” accessed 2026-07-23,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms709815%28v%3Dvs.85%29
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited page and inspect its statement about the Jet 4.0
  page-size change
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores a citation, not a redistributed
  copy
- Observation: Microsoft states that Jet 4.0 changed the page size from 2 KB to
  4 KB and that Jet 4.0 MDB files grow in 4-KB chunks.
- Interpretation: Jet 3.x uses 2 KiB pages and Jet 4.0 uses 4 KiB pages. This
  source establishes neither page-header semantics nor a version byte or other
  byte-level generation discriminator.
- Usage: `crates/jet3/src/header.rs`; `crates/jet3/src/database_header.rs`;
  `crates/jet3/src/jet3_page.rs`; `crates/jet3/src/candidate.rs`;
  `crates/jet3/src/raw_page_stream.rs`;
  `crates/jet3-cli/src/main.rs`; `EXP-0001`;
  `docs/validation/EXTERNAL_CORPUS.md`
- Rights: citation to public Microsoft documentation; no documentation content
  is redistributed
- Review: pending independent review

### SRC-0006 — DAO database-version mapping

- Recorded: 2026-07-23, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: How does Microsoft map Jet engine releases to Access releases, and
  what does DAO `Database.Version` report?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “Database.Version property (DAO),” accessed
  2026-07-23,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/database-version-property-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited page, inspect the description of the read-only
  `Database.Version` string, and inspect the Microsoft product-version table
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores a citation, not a redistributed
  copy
- Observation: Microsoft documents `Database.Version` as reporting the database
  engine version that created a database. Its table maps Microsoft Jet 3.5
  (1996) to Microsoft Access '97 (8.0), and Microsoft Jet 4.0 (2000) to
  Microsoft Access 2000 (9.0).
- Interpretation: a DAO oracle can use the documented API result as independent
  application-level evidence of the creating engine and can relate Jet 3.5 to
  Access 97. This is API behavior only; it establishes no file-layout field,
  version byte, or page-header semantic.
- Usage: contextual provenance for future DAO evidence; not currently cited by
  production code
- Rights: citation to public Microsoft documentation; no documentation content
  is redistributed
- Review: pending independent review

### SRC-0007 — Jet 3.5 format continuity and physical-design concepts

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: What physical-design facts does Microsoft publish for the Jet 3.5
  engine used by Access 97, and which of those facts are sufficient for binary
  implementation?
- Origin: Microsoft Support, “Rediscovered JET and ODBC white papers,” and the
  linked Microsoft download archive containing Kevin Collins, “Microsoft Jet
  3.5 Performance Overview and Optimization Techniques,” dated 1997-03-06;
  accessed 2026-07-24,
  https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/Access/rediscovered-jet-and-odbc-white-papers
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system and architecture are
  not material; provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not
  applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the Microsoft Support page, follow its Microsoft-hosted
  white-paper download, verify the archive and `v35perf.doc` hashes below, and
  inspect only the Microsoft-authored Jet 3.5 performance paper
- Artifacts: Microsoft download archive SHA-256
  `fcd3b414dc9c1053a1f7db97a132561924dff2631f14d600805f8f5dab32ffd8`;
  contained `v35perf.doc` SHA-256
  `4e5919f144f0b1d9be6481a452ed33c4332f3acc903d42ea78a7d52f07b7104e`;
  neither artifact is redistributed by this repository
- Observation: Microsoft states that Jet 3.5 introduces no data-format change
  from Jet 3.0 and requires no database data conversion. The paper names a
  database header page, data pages, index B-tree pages, long-value pages for
  Memo/OLE values, and directory pages. It describes allocation by extents of
  up to eight 2-KiB pages in Jet 3.0 and up to 32 pages in Jet 3.5 for large
  tables. It also describes compaction as recopying pages and recreating
  indexes.
- Interpretation: Access 97's Jet 3.5 data format may be treated as the Jet 3.x
  format requested by DAO `dbVersion30`, and the named page/allocation concepts
  may guide controlled oracle scenarios. The source publishes no binary page
  tags, header-field offsets, allocation-map encoding, catalog root, row
  layout, or long-value pointers, so none of those details may be inferred or
  implemented from this source.
- Usage: clean-room experiment planning and future DAO scenario design; not
  currently cited by production code
- Rights: citation to Microsoft-authored public material; no white-paper
  content is redistributed
- Review: pending independent review

### SRC-0008 — ESE/JET Blue is not the Access JET Red format

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: May Microsoft's Extensible Storage Engine physical documentation
  be used as a format source for Access MDB files?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “Extensible Storage Engine,” accessed 2026-07-24,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/extensible-storage-engine/extensible-storage-engine
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited page and inspect the Notes section that
  distinguishes JET Blue/ESE from the JET Red engine used by Microsoft Access
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores a citation, not a redistributed
  copy
- Observation: Microsoft documents JET Blue/ESE and Access JET Red as separate,
  independently maintained, non-interchangeable implementations.
- Interpretation: ESE file headers, page layouts, checksums, tags, APIs, and
  other physical details are inapplicable to this project and are prohibited
  as Jet 3 MDB format evidence unless Microsoft explicitly labels a fact as
  JET Red.
- Usage: clean-room research boundary; not cited by production code
- Rights: citation to public Microsoft documentation; no documentation content
  is redistributed
- Review: pending independent review

### SRC-0009 — DAO data-type enumeration for controlled M1 fields

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: Which DAO enumeration members and numeric values name the four
  field types used by the controlled M1 generation plans?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “DataTypeEnum enumeration (DAO),” accessed
  2026-07-24,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/datatypeenum-enumeration-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited Microsoft Learn page and inspect only the rows
  for `dbBinary`, `dbText`, `dbLongBinary`, and `dbMemo`
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores a citation, not a redistributed
  copy
- Observation: Microsoft identifies `dbBinary` value 9 as binary data,
  `dbText` value 10 as variable-width text, `dbLongBinary` value 11 as binary
  data, and `dbMemo` value 12 as extended text.
- Interpretation: a future late-bound DAO adapter may use these names and
  numeric values when creating the four controlled field kinds. They are API
  enumeration values only; they do not identify MDB type bytes, physical
  layouts, long-value thresholds, page classes, or storage strategies.

### SRC-0010 — DAO field creation and documented text-size bound

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: Which DAO API creates a table field, and is a size of eight a
  documented-safe value for a Microsoft Access `dbText` field?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “TableDef.CreateField method (DAO)” and “Field.Size
  property (DAO),” accessed 2026-07-24,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/tabledef-createfield-method-dao
  and
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/field-size-property-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve both cited pages; inspect the `CreateField(Name, Type,
  Size)` parameter descriptions and the Microsoft Access text-size remarks
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores citations, not redistributed
  copies
- Observation: Microsoft documents `TableDef.CreateField` as creating a field
  in a Microsoft Access workspace. For Microsoft Access Text fields,
  `Field.Size` may be an integer up to 255; Long Binary and Memo report size
  zero, and types other than Text determine their size from the type.
- Interpretation: `dbText` size 8 is within the documented API range. The M1
  plans therefore declare `size` only for `dbText`; they do not invent sizes
  for `dbBinary`, `dbMemo`, or `dbLongBinary`. The source does not specify an
  on-disk width field, encoding, row layout, or long-value cutoff.
- Usage: `oracle/windows-dao/protocol/v1_1/scenario.schema.json`;

### SRC-0011 — DAO nonunique secondary-index construction

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: Which DAO object operations define an index, and what does the
  `Unique` property mean?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “Index object (DAO),” “Index.CreateField method
  (DAO),” and “Index.Unique property (DAO),” accessed 2026-07-24,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/index-object-dao,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/index-createfield-method-dao,
  and
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/index-unique-property-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the three cited pages and inspect the documented index
  construction sequence, index-field method, and `Unique` semantics
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores citations, not redistributed
  copies
- Observation: Microsoft directs callers to create an Index from a TableDef,
  create and append its field objects, set index properties, and append the
  Index. It documents `Unique = False` as a secondary index that does not serve
  as a unique identifier, and states that indexes affect record access order
  rather than base-table physical order.
- Interpretation: the controlled text pair may add one nonprimary index with
  `Unique = False` over the existing `dbText(8)` field. No physical record
  order, index page, B-tree encoding, page tag, or allocation effect is
  predicted from the API documentation.
- Usage: `oracle/windows-dao/examples/DAO-GEN-TEXT8-INDEXED-001.scenario.json`;
  `oracle/windows-dao/examples/DAO-PAIR-TEXT8-INDEX-001.pair.json`

### SRC-0012 — DAO row and long-value APIs; PowerShell marshalling gap

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: Which DAO APIs add rows and transfer Memo or Long Binary values,
  and do the reviewed Microsoft sources define late-bound PowerShell binary
  marshalling for those calls?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “Recordset.AddNew method (DAO),” “Field.Value
  property (DAO),” “Field.AppendChunk method (DAO),” and “Field.FieldSize
  property (DAO),” accessed 2026-07-24,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/recordset-addnew-method-dao,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/field-value-property-dao,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/field-appendchunk-method-dao,
  and
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/field-fieldsize-property-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited pages; inspect the AddNew/Update lifecycle,
  `Field.Value` value contract, `AppendChunk` parameter and sequencing remarks,
  and `FieldSize` scope
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores citations, not redistributed
  copies
- Observation: Microsoft documents `AddNew`, field assignment, and `Update` as
  the row-insertion lifecycle. `Field.Value` accepts a Variant appropriate to
  the field type. `AppendChunk` appends a Variant of String subtype to Memo or
  Long Binary fields, with the first call replacing and subsequent calls
  appending within one AddNew/Edit session. `FieldSize` reports bytes used by a
  Memo or Long Binary record field. The reviewed pages contain no contract for
  how PowerShell late-bound COM maps a .NET string or byte array into the exact
  Variant representation expected by a Jet 3 DAO provider.
- Interpretation: the M1 plans may name deterministic semantic input values
  and lengths, but an executor is blocked until a provisioned Windows
  experiment establishes binary and long-binary marshalling and readback. The
  planned lengths are experiment points, not documented storage thresholds.
  Nothing here establishes page, tag, pointer, row, or long-value layout.

### SRC-0013 — Jet 3 database-header commit region and `.ldb` locking context

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: Which portion of the Jet 3.0/3.5 database header page stores
  per-connection commit state, and what contextual limits apply when reading
  it?
- Origin: Microsoft Support, “Rediscovered JET and ODBC white papers,” and the
  linked Microsoft-hosted archive containing Kevin Collins, “Understanding
  Microsoft Jet Locking,” updated for Jet 3.5 and DAO 3.5; accessed
  2026-07-24,
  https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/Access/rediscovered-jet-and-odbc-white-papers
- Environment: documentation retrieval on macOS 26.3.1 arm64; provider
  version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the Microsoft-hosted
  `JetWhitePapers_UPDATE1.zip` from the Support page; verify the archive and
  contained `Jetlock.docx` hashes below; inspect the “Layout of the .Ldb File,”
  “Database Header Page,” and lock-description sections of only that
  Microsoft-authored paper
- Artifacts: Microsoft download archive SHA-256
  `fcd3b414dc9c1053a1f7db97a132561924dff2631f14d600805f8f5dab32ffd8`;
  contained `Jetlock.docx` SHA-256
  `2a4a9c00ea6e817751b7bb3d3d76f124156da2cafa61ddd4cdd8f44cde3383fe`;
  neither artifact is redistributed by this repository
- Observation: Microsoft identifies the first database page as the database
  header page. For Jet 3.0 and 3.5 it identifies the 512 bytes beginning at
  hexadecimal offset `0x600` and ending at the 2-KiB page boundary `0x800` as
  256 two-byte commit-state slots. The first pair is used for an exclusive
  connection and the remaining 255 pairs for shared users. It assigns
  `00 00` to a user physically writing to disk and `01 00` to a user that
  accessed a corrupted page, while warning that many other pair values are
  valid internal cache-coordination states. The applicable shared-user slot is
  determined by a corresponding operating-system byte-range lock on the
  companion `.ldb` file. The paper also documents up to 255 physical `.ldb`
  entries of 64 bytes—32 bytes for computer name and 32 for security name—and
  a maximum physical `.ldb` size of 16,320 bytes.
- Interpretation: production code may expose the complete 256 raw two-byte
  slots from the documented first-page range and may name the two documented
  pair values. It must preserve all other pairs without rejecting them and
  must not infer database validity, corruption, clean shutdown, Jet generation,
  user ownership, or compatibility from MDB bytes alone. Contextual state
  diagnosis requires contemporaneous `.ldb` lock evidence from a controlled
  Windows experiment. The source publishes no page tag, table-header location,
  catalog root, allocation encoding, row layout, index encoding, or long-value
  pointer.

### SRC-0014 — DAO creation version and encryption controls

- Recorded: 2026-07-25, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: Which documented DAO inputs select Jet 2.0, Jet 3.0, or Jet 4.0
  data formats during database creation, and which input selects or omits
  encryption?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “DBEngine.CreateDatabase method (DAO)” and
  “DatabaseTypeEnum enumeration (DAO),” accessed 2026-07-25,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/dbengine-createdatabase-method-dao
  and
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/databasetypeenum-enumeration-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve both cited Microsoft Learn pages; inspect the
  `CreateDatabase` `Option` parameter and option table, then inspect only the
  `dbVersion20`, `dbVersion30`, `dbVersion40`, and `dbEncrypt` enumeration
  rows
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores citations, not redistributed
  copies
- Observation: Microsoft documents `dbVersion20`, `dbVersion30`, and
  `dbVersion40` as requesting Jet 2.0, Jet 3.0 (compatible with 3.5), and Jet
  4.0 file formats respectively. The enumeration page assigns them API values
  16, 32, and 64. Microsoft assigns `dbEncrypt` API value 2, documents it as
  creating an encrypted database, and states that omitting the encryption
  constant creates an unencrypted database.
- Interpretation: the M4 DAO-only experiment may use those named options and
  late-bound numeric API values as a controlled 3-by-2 creation factorial.
  These values are COM/DAO inputs only. They do not identify MDB bytes,
  offsets, bit masks, encryption algorithms, keys, page classes, or any other
  physical encoding, and a successful call does not establish Rust
  compatibility.

### SRC-0015 — DAO database-version result labels

- Recorded: 2026-07-25, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: What does DAO `Database.Version` report, and how is its result
  formatted for the three M4 creation-version conditions?

  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/database-version-property-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited Microsoft Learn page; inspect the property
  description, the documented `major.minor` result form, and the rows for
  Microsoft Jet 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores a citation, not a redistributed
  copy
- Observation: Microsoft documents the read-only string as the version of the
  database engine that created the database and gives its result form as
  `major.minor`, with `3.0` as the example. The product table separately names
  Jet releases 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0.
- Interpretation: combining this API-result contract with the creation-format
  options in `SRC-0014`, the checked M4 oracle expects exact labels `2.0`,
  `3.0`, and `4.0` for its respective `dbVersion20`, `dbVersion30`, and
  `dbVersion40` files. A different result must fail the experiment rather than
  be recast as a physical-format fact. The label is application-level oracle
  evidence only; it is not an MDB version field, byte string, encoding, or
  Rust compatibility result.

### SRC-0016 — DAO compact-copy version and encryption controls

- Recorded: 2026-07-25, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: public source
- Question: Which version and encryption changes does Microsoft document for
  DAO `CompactDatabase`, and should that second creation path participate in
  the primary M4 factorial?
- Origin: Microsoft Learn, “DBEngine.CompactDatabase method (DAO),” accessed
  2026-07-25,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/dbengine-compactdatabase-method-dao
- Environment: documentation retrieval; operating system, architecture,
  provider version, locale, code pages, and time zone are not applicable
- Protocol: retrieve the cited Microsoft Learn page; inspect the `Options`
  parameter, encryption-option table, version-option table, and restrictions
  immediately following those tables
- Artifacts: not applicable; the project stores a citation, not a redistributed
  copy
- Observation: Microsoft documents `dbEncrypt` and `dbDecrypt` as compact-copy
  encryption controls, states that omitting an encryption constant preserves
  source encryption, permits only one version constant, and documents
  `dbVersion20`, `dbVersion30`, and `dbVersion40` as compact-copy data-format
  selections. It also states that the destination version may only be the same
  as or later than the source version.
- Interpretation: `CompactDatabase` provides a documented future independent
  conversion control, but the primary M4 creation factorial excludes it so
  that every sample has one generation path: `CreateDatabase`. None of these
  API controls specifies how version or encryption is represented on disk,
  and no compacted file may be treated as compatibility or physical-layout
  evidence without a separately checked experiment.
- Usage: explicit exclusion and future-control rationale in
  `oracle/windows-dao/experiments/m4/README.md` and

## Observed behavior

### OBS-0001 — Donated-corpus identity and header bytes

- Recorded: 2026-07-23, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: observation
- Question: Do the four donated candidates have the donor-supplied identities,
  and what bytes occur at the Microsoft-published Jet signature offset?
- Origin: direct inspection of `FIX-0001` through `FIX-0004`; the files remain
  outside the repository beneath the opt-in `JET3_EXTERNAL_FIXTURE_ROOT`
- Environment: macOS 26.3.1 build 25D771280a on arm64; `file(1)` 5.41; locale
  `C.UTF-8`; time zone `America/New_York`; code pages are not applicable
- Protocol: for each exact relative locator in `FIX-0001` through `FIX-0004`,
  recompute its byte count and SHA-256, invoke `file(1)`, and read exactly 15
  bytes beginning at offset `0x4`; the reproducible command sequence is in
  `docs/validation/EXTERNAL_CORPUS.md`
- Artifacts: `FIX-0001`, 1,593,344 bytes,
  SHA-256 `5c18e9d85c2c91a1afdd6d2ddc64c990fd1442c01c753a5d76d4b6d15259537b`;
  `FIX-0002`, 1,593,344 bytes,
  SHA-256 `0a68f70d901d4b519b765323c141c794b427f3d4ee25ef2bd390ce2a493378d9`;
  `FIX-0003`, 1,220,608 bytes,
  SHA-256 `d8dba78c0ce51614f0099e9db7b2cd10790935ffb5db989db5fc766b7c5881fa`;
  `FIX-0004`, 2,129,920 bytes,
  SHA-256 `42aa474ee656d3f1249af08424ed92c91be1388b308906cafb54b4e7ff812d61`
- Observation: the recomputed sizes and SHA-256 values matched the fixture
  records. `file(1)` provided only a generic identification, not a specific Jet
  generation. Every candidate contained the exact 15 bytes `Standard Jet DB`
  (hexadecimal `53 74 61 6e 64 61 72 64 20 4a 65 74 20 44 42`) at offset
  `0x4`.
- Interpretation: all four candidates have stable local identities and match
  one Microsoft-published Jet signature. This does not prove the donor's Access
  97 claim, structural validity, semantic correctness, or DAO compatibility.
- Usage: `EXP-0001`; `docs/validation/EXTERNAL_CORPUS.md`
- Rights: local inspection only under the donor's authorization; no
  redistribution grant; the files and extracted bytes beyond the stated
  observation must not be committed
- Review: pending independent review

## Experiments

### EXP-0001 — Candidate page-stride boundary-byte survey

- Recorded: 2026-07-23, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: experiment
- Question: Does a 1,024-byte or 2,048-byte power-of-two stride produce a
  restricted family of first-byte values at boundaries in the four donated
  candidates?
- Origin: boundary-byte measurements on `FIX-0001` through `FIX-0004`, whose
  identities were checked in `OBS-0001`
- Environment: macOS 26.3.1 build 25D771280a on arm64; `xxd` 2025-08-24 for the
  recorded sampling; Python 3.14.3 for the documented reproduction; locale
  `C.UTF-8`; time zone `America/New_York`; code pages are not applicable
- Protocol: independently for strides 1,024 and 2,048, read the unsigned byte
  at offset zero and every positive multiple of the stride that is less than
  the file length, then sort and deduplicate the values for each file; the
  exact reproducible procedure is in
  `docs/validation/EXTERNAL_CORPUS.md`
- Artifacts: `FIX-0001` through `FIX-0004`; no derived corpus bytes are retained
- Observation: at the 2,048-byte boundaries, `FIX-0001` and `FIX-0002` each
  produced `{00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 09}`, while `FIX-0003` and `FIX-0004` each
  produced `{00, 01, 02, 04, 09}`. The 1,024-byte stride produced many values
  rather than a comparably restricted family.
- Interpretation: 2,048 bytes is the smallest tested power-of-two stride that
  exhibits a restricted boundary-byte family across this four-file corpus.
  That observation is consistent with `SRC-0005` for the donor-declared Jet 3
  candidates, but it does not itself identify their generation or page types
  and is not universal compatibility proof.
- Usage: `SRC-0005`; `docs/validation/EXTERNAL_CORPUS.md`; exploratory evidence
  only, not currently cited by production code
- Rights: local inspection only under the donor's authorization; no
  redistribution grant; no source files or derived byte corpus are committed
- Review: pending independent review

### EXP-0002 — Candidate 2-KiB boundary-prefix frequencies

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: experiment
- Question: How often does each first-byte value occur at 2,048-byte
  boundaries in the four donated candidates, and what second byte follows
  nonzero first bytes?
- Origin: boundary-prefix measurements on `FIX-0001` through `FIX-0004`, whose
  identities were checked in `OBS-0001`
- Environment: macOS 26.3.1 build 25D771280a on arm64; Python 3.14.3; locale
  `C.UTF-8`; time zone `America/New_York`; code pages are not applicable
- Protocol: set `JET3_EXTERNAL_FIXTURE_ROOT` and run
  `tools/inspect_external_corpus.py`. After verifying each exact fixture's
  regular-file status, size, and SHA-256, the tool reads up to two bytes at
  offset zero and every successive 2,048-byte boundary, reports a sorted
  first-byte histogram, counts nonzero first bytes, and counts those whose
  available second byte is `0x01`. It rejects unexpected short reads and a file
  that changes during inspection.
- Artifacts: `FIX-0001` through `FIX-0004`; the deterministic JSON observation
  is generated on demand and binds itself to the repository commit and dirty
  state; no corpus bytes are retained
- Observation: `FIX-0001` and `FIX-0002` each had 778 boundaries with
  histograms `{00:34, 01:646, 02:28, 03:7, 04:62, 09:1}` and
  `{00:34, 01:439, 02:28, 03:7, 04:62, 09:208}`, respectively. `FIX-0003`
  had 596 boundaries with `{00:1, 01:437, 02:79, 04:37, 09:42}`.
  `FIX-0004` had 1,040 boundaries with
  `{00:1, 01:778, 02:190, 04:37, 09:34}`. Across all four candidates, every
  one of the 3,122 boundaries with a nonzero first byte had second byte
  `0x01`.
- Interpretation: the restricted first-byte family and stable second byte are
  candidate invariants for future controlled DAO-generated differential
  experiments. Related controller files are not an independent or sufficiently
  varied population, so these values do not establish page-type tags, header
  semantics, validity, Jet generation, or compatibility and are not used by
  production code.
- Usage: `docs/validation/EXTERNAL_CORPUS.md`; exploratory evidence only
- Rights: local inspection only under the donor's authorization; no
  redistribution grant; no source files or derived byte corpus are committed
- Review: pending independent review

### EXP-0003 — Related-snapshot same-index page comparison

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: experiment
- Question: For the exact equal-length `FIX-0001` and `FIX-0002` donor
  snapshots, what byte-level differences occur between pages at the same
  2,048-byte index?
- Origin: positional comparison of `FIX-0001` and `FIX-0002`, whose identities
  were checked in `OBS-0001`; the manifest declares the directional comparison
  as `CMP-0001`
- Environment: macOS 26.3.1 build 25D771280a on arm64; Python 3.14.3; locale
  `C.UTF-8`; time zone `America/New_York`; code pages are not applicable
- Protocol: set `JET3_EXTERNAL_FIXTURE_ROOT` and run
  `tools/inspect_external_corpus.py`. The verifier independently rechecks both
  exact files' regular-file status, equal page-aligned size, and SHA-256, then
  reads corresponding complete 2,048-byte pages. It reports a sorted
  first-byte transition matrix, full-page equality counts, and an exact
  2,048-element vector counting differing page pairs at each byte offset. It
  rejects short reads and either file changing during the comparison.
- Artifacts: `FIX-0001`, `FIX-0002`, and manifest comparison `CMP-0001`; the
  deterministic JSON observation is generated on demand and binds itself to
  the repository commit and dirty state; no source or derived corpus bytes are
  retained
- Observation: the 778 same-index page pairs comprised 345 byte-identical and
  433 differing pairs. The first-byte transitions were `00→00:34`,
  `01→01:439`, `01→09:207`, `02→02:28`, `03→03:7`, `04→04:62`, and
  `09→09:1`. The differing pairs contained 89,078 differing byte positions;
  2,043 of the 2,048 page-relative byte offsets differed in at least one pair.
- Interpretation: this is an uncontrolled positional comparison of related
  donor snapshots. Equal length does not establish stable logical page
  identity. The first-byte values are candidate cohorts only and establish no
  page tag, page class, allocation state, header field, row meaning, validity,
  Jet generation, DAO result, or compatibility. Page semantics require
  replicated single-variable DAO-generated fixtures and commit-bound DAO
  evidence.
- Usage: `docs/validation/EXTERNAL_CORPUS.md`; exploratory evidence only; not
  cited by production code
- Rights: local inspection only under the donor's authorization; no
  redistribution grant; no source files or derived byte corpus are committed
- Review: pending independent review

### EXP-0004 — Bounded raw-candidate CLI scan

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: experiment
- Question: Does the commit-bound raw-candidate CLI read each exact donated
  candidate within explicit byte and page ceilings and produce deterministic,
  content-agnostic checksums?
- Origin: `FIX-0001` through `FIX-0004`, whose identities were independently
  rechecked against the manifest before the CLI run
- Environment: macOS 26.3.1 build 25D771280a on arm64; Rust 1.96.0; locale
  `C.UTF-8`; time zone `America/New_York`; code pages are not applicable;
  clean repository commit `8ef548bd7bfd64cf9a53068aded473adef75de85`
- Protocol: set `JET3_EXTERNAL_FIXTURE_ROOT`, run
  `tools/inspect_external_corpus.py`, then invoke `jet3-probe` separately for
  each exact manifest locator with `--max-input-bytes` and
  `--max-scan-bytes` equal to its verified size and `--max-pages` equal to its
  exact 2,048-byte page count. The CLI reads every complete candidate page
  once, charges every checksum byte as explicit work, and emits JSON containing
  its non-claim caveats.
- Artifacts: `FIX-0001` through `FIX-0004`; no corpus bytes or derived content
  are retained
- Observation: the four runs respectively reported 778, 778, 596, and 1,040
  pages; checksums `a8da368cdc8c57ae`, `fa78882d0bb856f7`,
  `b4cf9e2ba6d4ea1e`, and `8472e0756be09d7f`; and total work counts 1,594,122,
  1,594,122, 1,221,204, and 2,130,960. All four retained the generic
  `standard` signature classification and exact 2,048-byte arithmetic
  geometry.
- Interpretation: this reproduces bounded raw transfer and checksum accounting
  over four exact external candidates. A checksum match is a tool regression
  observation only. It does not identify Jet generation or encryption state,
  validate structure or semantics, prove safe DAO opening, or establish
  compatibility.
- Usage: `docs/validation/EXTERNAL_CORPUS.md`; exploratory tool evidence only;
  not cited by production code or the support matrix
- Rights: local inspection only under the donor's authorization; no
  redistribution grant; no source files or derived byte corpus are committed
- Review: pending independent review

### EXP-0005 — DAO system-table attribute mask on an empty Jet 3 database

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: experiment and black-box result
- Question: Does the checked M0 runner's equality test correctly recognize the
  system tables returned by DAO after creating and reopening an empty
  `dbVersion30` database?
- Origin: project protocol scenario `DAO-GEN-PROBE-001` executed through
  Microsoft DAO 3.6; no donated database or third-party MDB implementation was
  used
- Environment: Windows 11 Pro 10.0.22631 on x64; 32-bit Windows PowerShell
  5.1.22621.6133; culture `en-US`; ANSI code page 1252; Eastern Standard Time;
  `DAO.DBEngine.36` provider version 3.6 from `dao360.dll` file version

  `4cc28a5be8dc7425a4c4c1ef275ca392f18be35d70232e777dce6d9f3b4d79ac`;
  clean repository commit `0804fea6b04a4b3034b2d29cfd627c1e55d9b62b`
- Protocol: run the checked protocol-1.0 provider probe and require its
  disposable `dbVersion30` test to pass; run the checked M0 scenario; then, in
  a separate disposable database created with the same provider and arguments,
  enumerate `TableDefs` and record each name, signed `Attributes` value, and
  the result of bitwise AND with the Microsoft-documented `dbSystemObject`
  value. Delete the separate database after closing all DAO objects.
- Artifacts: retained outside the repository under
  `%TEMP%\jet3-rs-dao-m0\evidence\0804fea6b04a4b3034b2d29cfd627c1e55d9b62b\20260724T234224Z-dao-m0`;

  `46e4f7a30a6bac11c30eaa825acd4d47d0e5374eef62a1b5368c38b56773c0e0`
- Observation: the checked M0 run created and closed an unencrypted
  `dbVersion30` MDB, then failed after reopening because it reported
  `MSysACEs`, `MSysObjects`, `MSysQueries`, and `MSysRelationships` as user
  tables. The separate enumeration returned signed `Attributes`
  `-2147483648` (`0x80000000`) for each table. Bitwise AND with
  `dbSystemObject` value `-2147483646` returned `-2147483648`, which is
  nonzero but is not equal to the full enumeration value.
- Interpretation: `dbSystemObject` must be tested as a bitmask with a nonzero
  result; requiring equality with the complete enumeration value rejects the
  system tables observed here. This conclusion is limited to the DAO API
  filtering behavior of the M0 oracle and establishes no MDB byte layout,
  general table semantics, or product compatibility.

### EXP-0006 — PowerShell byte-array marshalling through DAO 3.6

- Recorded: 2026-07-24, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: experiment and black-box result
- Question: Which late-bound PowerShell runtime value and DAO API operation
  deterministically round-trip the controlled `dbBinary` marker and
  `dbLongBinary` boundary ladder?
- Origin: project-controlled values from protocol 1.1, executed by
  `oracle/windows-dao/experiments/m1-marshalling-probe.ps1`; no donated
  database or third-party MDB implementation was used
- Environment: Windows 11 Pro 10.0.22631 on x64; x86 Windows PowerShell
  5.1.22621.6133; CLR 4.0.30319.42000; culture `en-US`; ANSI code page 1252;

  `4cc28a5be8dc7425a4c4c1ef275ca392f18be35d70232e777dce6d9f3b4d79ac`;
  clean repository commit `be8e0c9943fdab088a5a08be956435c897a4a1f2`
- Protocol: require a ready protocol-1.1 environment whose process
  architecture and provider binary hash match the running process; require the
  exact clean Git commit; create a disposable `dbVersion30` database; test the
  fixed eight-byte marker through direct `Field.Value`, `AppendChunk`, and a
  unary-comma wrapper; test locally constructed `System.Byte[]` values filled
  with `0xa5` through `dbLongBinary.AppendChunk` at lengths 1, 2047, 2048,
  2049, 32767, 32768, and 32769; read every successful value through DAO and
  record its CLR type and exact bytes or SHA-256; retain failure type, HRESULT,
  and message; delete the disposable database after hashing it
- Artifacts: ready environment record retained outside the repository,
  SHA-256

  `cf36d297d88d0d6d6f22b1d4a018479a335be7a38b4b301b0a195fc0e632ad28`
- Observation: direct assignment of the marker as `System.Byte[]` to
  `dbBinary.Value` returned `System.Byte[]` with exact hex
  `0011223344556677`. `dbBinary.AppendChunk(System.Byte[])` failed with COM
  HRESULT `0x800A0CBB` (“Invalid field data type”), and assigning the
  unary-comma wrapper failed with `0x800A0D5D` (“Data type conversion error”).
  `dbLongBinary.AppendChunk(System.Byte[])` passed at every controlled length;
  every DAO readback was `System.Byte[]` with the exact input length and
  SHA-256.
- Interpretation: on this exact x86 PowerShell/DAO environment, an M1 executor
  may use a locally constructed, non-enumerated `System.Byte[]` with direct
  `Value` assignment for `dbBinary` and `AppendChunk` for `dbLongBinary`.
  PowerShell functions returning a byte array must preserve it as one pipeline
  object. This establishes only the adapter representation and DAO API
  behavior; it establishes no MDB physical layout, general compatibility, or
  passing protocol scenario.

  `oracle/windows-dao/scripts/run-m1-controlled.ps1`
- Rights: generated locally through a licensed Microsoft DAO provider; the
  result JSON is retained locally and the disposable MDB was deleted
- Review: the executor use of this result received an independent adversarial
  review on 2026-07-24; all actionable binding, cleanup, publication,
  boundedness, and failure-evidence findings were addressed before the passing
  M1 run. This review does not itself make the experiment protocol evidence.

### EXP-0007 — Complete controlled M1 DAO generation and readback

- Recorded: 2026-07-25, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: controlled black-box DAO evidence
- Question: Does the exact reviewed executor deterministically create, reopen,

  text ladders at lengths 1, 2047, 2048, 2049, 32767, 32768, and 32769,
  the controlled `dbText(8)` rows, the repeated empty-database equivalence
  pair, and the single nonunique text-index difference pair.
- Interpretation: this is commit-bound Microsoft DAO evidence for only the
  controlled DAO-generation/readback inventory and its exact environment. It
  establishes no Rust reader, writer, update behavior, MDB physical-layout
  conclusion, donated-fixture compatibility, or general Access 97 support.
  Consequently no product capability advances to `dao_opened` or
  `dao_differential`.

  `docs/validation/M1_DAO_EVIDENCE.md`
- Rights: generated locally through the licensed provider; retained outside
  the repository and not redistributed
- Review: executor received the independent adversarial review described
  above; the published bundle passed a separate invocation of the checked
  protocol-1.1 validator

### EXP-0008 — Controlled M1 physical page-difference observation

- Recorded: 2026-07-25, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: bounded descriptive experiment over controlled DAO output
- Question: Which complete 2-KiB pages and common-length byte positions differ
  between the two controlled M1 scenario pairs, without assigning physical
  format semantics?
- Origin: only the seven project-generated databases in the passing
  `EXP-0007` bundle; no donated database, external MDB, or third-party MDB
  implementation was read
- Environment: Microsoft Windows 10.0.22631 x64; PowerShell 7.4.17; culture
  `en-US`; UTF-8 default and output code page 65001; Eastern Standard Time;
  exact clean pushed observer commit
  `550ddc266eddf7e6765cf929ef50fd5aac19c542`
- Protocol: require the exact clean observer commit, exact `EXP-0007` manifest
  SHA-256, complete passing seven-scenario/two-pair protocol-1.1 validation,
  the 2,048-byte Jet 3 page size established by `SRC-0005`, and page-aligned
  databases within the 16-MiB per-file ceiling; hash each complete page in
  physical order; compare only the two declared pair sides; record differing
  page indices, common-length byte difference counts and first/last offsets,
  and length differences; publish one collision-refusing, fsynced JSON file
  outside the repository; independently rerun the M1 validator and recompute
  all page-hash sequences and pair byte bounds with PowerShell/.NET SHA-256
- Artifacts: source bundle from `EXP-0007`, manifest SHA-256
  `9bc59d5db419e7283d8013d34e4fea16c3a9add8830c392294b8a8b6b1c32685`;

  `59d38601f5c8214a3eaa85b140461de0b54d83bf8664d314c35cba8e5be6f445`
- Observation: the two equal-length repeated empty databases each contain 20
  pages; 151 common-length bytes differ across page indices 2, 3, 4, 5, 18,
  and 19, from absolute offset 4,206 through 40,691. The text baseline contains
  24 pages and the indexed variant 25; 740 bytes differ within their
  49,152-byte common length across page indices 1, 3, 4, 5, and 18 through 23,
  while page 24 is present only in the indexed file. The first and last
  common-length differences are at offsets 3,971 and 49,151.
- Interpretation: these exact-file observations do not identify a page class,
  header, field, row, index node, allocation record, nondeterministic field, or
  any other MDB structure. They establish no Rust compatibility and do not
  advance the support matrix. The repeated-empty differences also show why
  byte identity must not be assumed from semantic DAO equality.
- Usage: `oracle/windows-dao/scripts/observe_m1_pages.py`;
  `docs/validation/M2_PAGE_OBSERVATION.md`
- Rights: generated locally through the licensed provider in `EXP-0007`;
  retained outside the repository and not redistributed
- Review: the source M1 bundle independently revalidated, and an independent
  PowerShell/.NET pass exactly reproduced all seven page-hash sequences and
  both pair byte bounds

### EXP-0009 — Corrected M0 DAO generation and empty readback

- Recorded: 2026-07-25, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: controlled black-box DAO evidence
- Question: After correcting the system-table attribute test identified by
  `EXP-0005`, does the checked M0 executor create, reopen, and read back the
  empty `dbVersion30` scenario through DAO?
- Origin: project scenario `DAO-GEN-PROBE-001` executed through Microsoft DAO
  3.6; no donated database, external MDB, or third-party MDB implementation
  was used
- Environment: Windows 11 Pro 10.0.22631 on x64; x86 Windows PowerShell
  5.1.22621.6133; culture `en-US`; ANSI code page 1252; Eastern Standard Time;
  `DAO.DBEngine.36` from `dao360.dll` file version 03.60.9765.0, SHA-256

  exact clean commit `416b834b0d786fdf68efa066ab0e38409e443edf`
- Protocol: require the checked protocol-1.0 ready environment and exact clean
  commit; create an unencrypted disposable database with
  `CreateDatabase(..., dbVersion30)`; close and reopen it; exclude DAO system
  tables using a nonzero `dbSystemObject` bitmask result; retain the empty
  canonical DAO snapshot, operation log, database, report, environment, and
  manifest; independently rerun the checked protocol-1.0 bundle validator
- Artifacts: immutable bundle retained outside the repository at
  `%TEMP%\jet3-rs-dao-m0\evidence\416b834b0d786fdf68efa066ab0e38409e443edf\20260724T234905Z-dao-m0`;

- Observation: the retained manifest reports `pass` for the single
  `DAO-GEN-PROBE-001` scenario, and the checked protocol-1.0 validator accepted
  the complete immutable bundle again on 2026-07-25.
- Interpretation: the correction establishes only this exact empty
  DAO-generation/readback scenario and environment. It proves no Rust
  behavior, general schema support, physical MDB layout, or compatibility on
  a later release commit.
- Usage: `oracle/windows-dao/scripts/run-dao-gen-probe.ps1`;

### EXP-0010 — Replicated DAO physical-delta isolation

- Recorded: 2026-07-25, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: repeated controlled black-box DAO generation and bounded descriptive
  physical observation
- Question: Across fresh independent DAO processes, which absolute byte/page
  differences are run-specific within repeated empty, text-baseline, and
  text-plus-index cohorts, and which positions remain stable across the
  one-variable baseline/index contrast?
- Origin: three replicas each of the checked project-controlled
  `DAO-GEN-EMPTY-REPEAT-A`, `DAO-GEN-TEXT8-BASELINE-001`, and
  `DAO-GEN-TEXT8-INDEXED-001` scenarios; no donated database, external MDB, or
  third-party MDB implementation was used
- Environment: ready protocol-1.1 environment SHA-256

  exact clean pushed producer commit
  `9977745e6515363cbb179d8d949d34604554b2cd`
- Protocol: execute the checked cyclic schedule `E-B-I`, `B-I-E`, `I-E-B`
  through nine fresh x86 processes; require exact private origin/ref/commit,
  plan/scenario/environment/provider bindings before COM; create one fresh
  `dbVersion30` database per process; reopen and semantically read it through
  DAO; retain all nine databases, page hashes, 18 exact comparison bitmaps,
  three within-cohort variance bitmaps, paired/full-cross
  intersections/unions/histograms, and the stable-cohort delta bitmap;
  validate the complete private stage and publish by one collision-refusing
  same-volume directory rename
- Artifacts: immutable bundle retained outside the repository at
  `%TEMP%\jet3-rs-dao-m3\evidence\9977745e6515363cbb179d8d949d34604554b2cd\20260725T024333Z-dao-m3`;

  `5943e1a64a0b84916b814c76d87cb81192fb341da800769b1d7dbcb13378d9de`
- Observation: all nine DAO scenarios and all 18 comparisons passed. Every
  empty replica was 40,960 bytes, every text-baseline replica was 49,152
  bytes, and every indexed replica was 51,200 bytes. Within-cohort variance
  covered 122, 220, and 274 absolute byte positions for empty, baseline, and
  indexed cohorts respectively. Across the 49,152-byte baseline/index common
  length, 485 positions were stable within each cohort and different between
  cohorts; the indexed cohort also had one page present in every indexed
  replica and no baseline replica. The paired comparison intersection
  contained 717 positions and union 796; the full nine-way cross intersection
  contained 717 positions and union 798.
- Interpretation: these are descriptive absolute-position candidates for this
  exact nine-sample run only. They do not identify page classes, headers,
  catalog fields, rows, index nodes, allocation structures, or stable format
  offsets. They establish no Rust behavior or compatibility, do not satisfy
  exact-release G3, and do not change the support matrix.

  `docs/validation/M3_REPLICATED_DELTA_EVIDENCE.md`
- Rights: generated locally through the licensed Microsoft DAO provider;
  retained outside the repository and not redistributed
- Review: the executor/publisher received independent experimental-design,
  adversarial-safety, and thermo-nuclear maintainability reviews before COM;
  all actionable findings were fixed. The published bundle passed the checked
  validator and a separate PowerShell/.NET recomputation of every manifest
  file hash, database/page hash, cohort/comparison/stable bitmap, aggregate
  intersection/union, and occurrence histogram.

### EXP-0011 — Planned DAO version/encryption file-prefix campaign

- Recorded: 2026-07-25, OpenAI Codex
- Kind: declarative experiment plan; execution blocked pending checked tooling
- Question: Across six fresh-process replicas of each documented
  `dbVersion20`/`dbVersion30`/`dbVersion40` and
  unencrypted/`dbEncrypt` creation combination, which absolute positions in a
  bounded file prefix covary descriptively with an API factor after
  accounting for within-condition and no-op reopen variation?
- Origin: project-authored factorial plan using only the DAO controls and
  labels in `SRC-0014` and `SRC-0015`; the documented `CompactDatabase`
  controls in `SRC-0016` are deliberately excluded from the primary campaign
- Environment: not yet executed; the plan requires distinct fresh x86 creator
  and reopen workers per sample and leaves the exact Windows, PowerShell, DAO
  provider, locale, code-page, time-zone, repository, and commit identities to
  a future commit-bound environment record
- Protocol: a future checked validator must bind
  `oracle/windows-dao/experiments/m4/m4-header-discriminator.plan.json` and
  prove every relational and artifact invariant before any execution may
  begin. The future runner must execute its 3-by-2 factorial in the complete
  six-block cyclic schedule;
  clone each immutable closed creator database through a controller-owned,
  re-hashed, same-volume, non-hard-linked handoff before launching the separate
  reopen worker; retain paired closed-file creator/reopen observations; analyze
  only `[0x000,0x600)` from each 2,048-byte prefix; exclude `[0x600,0x800)`
  from every comparison; and validate the complete immutable bundle

  `6309fefdf95f9f725d11a190f4fef8fc8f132543bdc2a2cdd3fbe9f450a28982`
- Observation: no M4 sample has been generated and no M4 byte result exists.
  The declarative plan contains 36 samples, gives every condition every
  within-block launch position exactly once, requires 72 independently bound
  workers, and separately bounds retained bytes, five acquisition reads per
  pair, each validator pass, prefixes, comparison work, worker count, and time.
- Interpretation: this entry authorizes only implementation and review of
  checked M4 tooling. It does not authorize DAO execution. Even a future
  complete passing run may yield absolute candidate positions only. It may not
  assign physical meaning, change production code or the support matrix, or
  establish any Rust or MDB compatibility claim.
- Usage: `oracle/windows-dao/experiments/m4/`
- Rights: the plan and schemas are original project material; future generated
  databases and evidence must receive their own provenance and redistribution
  review
- Review: schema lint, checked plan identity/schedule/path/arithmetic tests,
  valid contract shapes, negative unknown/traversal/phase-drift checks, and
  provenance-hash tests passed locally on 2026-07-25. Schemas and tests do not
  implement the runner, analysis, or complete cross-document validator, so
  execution remains blocked.
